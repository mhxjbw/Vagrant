# Vagrant

# Overview

virtual machines. Those unfamiliar with the tool should [visit the Vagrant web site](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to learn more before reading any further.

# Getting Started
The files in this repository have been tested and used with each of the providers
customized in the individual vagrant files. Speaking generally, preference has been
given to VMware products (Workstation Pro 15.5.x and Fusion 11.5.x) but some also
support Parallels.
